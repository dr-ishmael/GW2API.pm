=========

GW2API is a class module that provides a set of standard interfaces to the Guild 
Wars 2 API.

Usage
-----

See [GW2API.pod](GW2API.pod) for full documentation.

Prerequisites
-------------

GW2API was written using Perl 5.16.  It uses the smartmatch operator (~~), thus 
it requires at least Perl 5.10.1. It should work with all versions after that, 
although this hasn't been tested.

GW2API requires the following modules, available from CPAN:

* [CHI](http://search.cpan.org/~jswartz/CHI-0.56/lib/CHI.pm)
* [JSON::XS](http://search.cpan.org/~mlehmann/JSON-XS-2.34/XS.pm)
* [LWP::UserAgent](search.cpan.org/~gaas/libwww-perl-6.05/lib/LWP/UserAgent.pm)
